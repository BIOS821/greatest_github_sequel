## Let the Story Begin!
Once upon a time, there was a very special woman with a very special power. 
This woman, also known as, GIT GIRL, was a super stupid content tracker!!!!

There was an ugly ogre who mad conflicts. 

He met the GIT girl and asked, 'Why do I always meet conflicts and cannot solve it?' The girl said, 'You should read the instruction for many times! and ask the StackOverflow!' The ogre understood and left to find a computer. (Stupid story)
