## Let the Story Begin!
Once upon a time, there was a very special woman with a very special power. 
This woman, also known as, GIT GIRL, was a super stupid content tracker!!!!

There was an ugly ogre who made conflicts

The ogre liked strawberry and GIT GIRL likes watermellon

The ogre said watermellon wasn't a real fruit, but GIT GIRL showed him otherwise

The ogre tried watermellon and liked it too.  Now GIT GIRL and the ogre are friends too.
