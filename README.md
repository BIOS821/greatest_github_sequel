## Let the Story Begin!
Once upon a time, there was a very special woman with a very special power. 
This woman, also known as, GIT GIRL, was a super stupid content tracker!!!!

There was an ugly ogre who mad conflicts

The ogre liked his privacy. But GIT GIRL was the super tracker that wouldn't quit.

GIT GIRL would follow the ogre everywhere, which made the ugly ogre very mad.
And when the ugly ogre ( whose name is Bob), gets mad, he likes to throw errors at GIT GIRL.


But fortunately she is good at catching errors, and eventually she moves on to tracking other stupid content. 

The End.
