## Let the Story Begin!
Once upon a time, there was a very special woman with a very special power. 
This woman, also known as, GIT GIRL, was a super stupid content tracker!!!!

There was an ugly ogre who mad conflicts

When trying to pull the newest version, git girl ran into a problem

The ugly ogre had changed her file and committed, and there was a merge conflict!!!

But no worries for git girl, for she was smart. She deleted the changes and committed and pulled again, and the day was saved.

All in a day's work for git girl.
